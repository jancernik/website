I wanted to try something different and went with a simple, flat monospace design.

While looking for inspiration, I found [the-monospace-web](https://github.com/owickstrom/the-monospace-web) by Oskar Wickström, an excellent project exploring monospace web design. While I didn't use it directly, it's worth checking out if you're interested in this design philosophy.
